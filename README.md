# MyFirstProject will be Fun and exciting

Project Philosophy:

One of the reasons why most students do not get most work done is due to distractions. Browsing on the internet and going back and forth on music app. With that in mind I created a web app where you can search for songs as well as get details about the songs and the artists.
This project was made with the intention to illustrate my passion for music and offer users good playlist. 

Features:
* Users can search for songs 
* can show images of their favorite musicians
*offers recommendations:
Which songs I recommend users to listen to while working on assignments
